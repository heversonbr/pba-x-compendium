= Wallets and Accounts

== Introduction

A wallet stores the cryptographic keys needed to access and manage digital assets on the blockchain.
It doesn't actually hold the cryptocurrency itself, but instead facilitates the secure storage and management of the keys required to carry out transactions.
They are known to be complicated even for technical people.

== Accounts and Self Custody

Creating a blockchain account is a simple process, we just need to have a crypto wallet.

Usually while creating an account we are given a 12 words pass phrase known as seed phrase or recovery phrase.
The 12-word phrase is a way to securely store your private key in a format that’s easy to write down and remember.
It can recreate your wallet on any compatible wallet app or device.

This seed phrase is an implementation of the `BIP-39` standard, which converts a randomly generated number
(the private key seed) into a list of 12, 18, or 24 simple words from a predefined list.

This makes it easier to back up and reduces human error compared to copying a long hexadecimal string.
It can be used across different wallets that follow the same standard, meaning you’re not locked into one wallet provider.

If someone has your seed phrase, they own your wallet. It’s more important than your password or device.
If you lose your seed phrase, you lose access to your funds forever. There is no `reset` option in decentralized systems.

*Types of wallets*

- *Hot Wallet*: A hot wallet is connected to the internet, allowing for easy and quick access to your digital assets.
They are typically used for daily transactions and trading due to their convenience.
Example: MetaMask
+
- *Cold Wallet*: A cold wallet is not connected to the internet, offering better security for the long-term storage of digital assets.
These are ideal for securely storing assets that aren't needed for daily transactions.
Example: Ledger
