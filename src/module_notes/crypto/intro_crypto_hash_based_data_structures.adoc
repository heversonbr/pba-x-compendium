= Hash based Data Structures

:todo: finish the description of topics
NOTE: TBD: work in progress, list of items to cover

== Data Structures for beginers

- What are data structures


Discuss few of them:

- Arrays
- LinkedLists
- Trees
-- max heap
-- binary search tree 

each data structure has its own advatages and cons, depending on the use case.
we will see later that blockchains benifit from organizing data in a specific structure 


== Hash Chains

- hash based data structures (breafly compare with pointers if it is a good thing)

key feature:  one-way functions
we cant have cyclic structures with hashes
hashes only allow to reference previous data, never future data

- hash chains , explain it and its features 



== Merkle Trees

- another key data structure in the context of block chains
- explain: binary tree where the value of each parent node is the hash of the child

- allows to prove the information  about the tree without reveal the entire dataset

- allow to commit to the entire the entire dataset , by using the root hash
 we cannot change anu part of the tree without changing the root
- explain why it is benificial for blockchains





=== Merkle Example


- give an example of how to built a merkle tree and how to prove / verify values with it




== Efficient data structures


- briefly explain key value data bases

- explain a trie

- radix trie

- patricia tries

- explain MMR Merkle mountain range

-- also explain how to build and prove/verify
-- mention advantatges regarding to traditional merkle trees.




== Take-away

- provide a summary/take-away
