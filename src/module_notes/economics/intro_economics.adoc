== Crypotography and Economics

We have seen that when we use cryptography along with mathematics and algorithms
we can have guarantees about the behavior of machines. Even when we use randomness
we can say that cryptography outputs the specific expected results and these results
provide a reliable way to secure the digital world.

On the other hand, the goal of almost any system is to interact with humans,
and when humans are involved things might not work as originally expected.

This is the reason we also need a good understanding of economics.
For instance, while cryptography might give us a commit-reveal scheme that works flawlessly
and could be used to run a sealed bid auction, economics explains why someone might choose
not to reveak their bid to manipulate the outcome.

People are complex and each individual may have their own preferences.
This is why the science of economics is much more subjective than mathematics and we should be
aware of its limitations. But we will see that on the agregatte humans often behave in expected ways.

The study of economics equip us with powerful toolbox to understand and predict the people's behavior.
We can then use this toolbox to understand why a system is designed the way it is or how it could be improved.

Economics along with cryptography will help us build resilient systems on a blockchain.
Economic concepts are also useful in our personal life. Knowing how human behave, or often how they
do not behave optimally, can guide us to make better decisions. It can help us all the way from
playing a game to designing a game, or even to starting a game company.

*Takeaways*:

- Cryptography and mathematics offer reliable, predictable guarantees about system behavior.
- Human behavior is less predictable and can undermine purely technical solutions.
- Economics helps us understand and anticipate how people actually behave, especially in systems involving incentives and choices.
- Combining cryptography and economics leads to the design of more secure, resilient, and practical systems, especially on blockchains.
- Economic insights are also valuable in everyday life, helping us make better decisions in games, system design, and business.


In the following we will discuss:

- Incentives: What motivate people to take actions/do things ?
- Behavioral biases: Where humans do not act as rationally as traditional economic theory predicts.
- Suply and demand: market equilibrium and elasticity.
- Different market forms: monopolies, oligopolies an perfect competition.
- Economics of specialization: focused on comparative advantages and opportunity costs, which shows why specialization benefits everyone.

== Can Incentives Go Wrong?

=== Incentives

[quote, Stephen Levitt]
----
An incetive is a bullet, a key, and often tiny object with astonishing power to change the situation.
----

Incentives motivate both individuals and groups to take specific actions.
They are used both at society-wide level and at the microeconomic level, such as between individuals.
Usually people think about financial incentives, but there are non-monetary incentives too.

Note that, a poorly designed incentive can backfire!

Example: *The Cobra Effect Story*

When India was under British rule, there was a significant problem with venomous cobra snakes, particularly in Delhi.
To reduce the cobra population, the British colonial government implemented a bounty system: they offered a financial reward for every dead cobra that people brought in.
Initially, the policy seemed to work well as large numbers of dead cobras were turned in.
However, people quickly realized they could profit from the situation by breeding cobras specifically to kill them and collect the bounty.
When the government discovered that people were farming cobras, they terminated the program.
With no incentive to keep the bred cobras, people released them, leading to an even worse cobra infestation than before the policy started.

This is a classic cautionary tale in economics and public policy about unintended consequences and poorly designed incentives.
The phenomenon is now widely known as the Cobra Effect: when an attempted solution to a problem actually makes the problem worse due to unforeseen behavioral responses to incentives.

Therefore, we need to make suke that incentives and goals are well aligned. 
If people focues on the incentive they tend to forget the goal behind it. 


*Takeaways*:

- Incentives shape behavior: People respond to incentives, consciously or unconsciously, adjusting their actions based on the rewards or penalties offered.
- Types of incentives matter: Incentives can be financial, social, moral, or coercive. Not all are about money.
- Poorly designed incentives can backfire: If an incentive is not carefully planned, it can encourage people to game the system or focus on the reward instead of the actual goal.
- The Cobra Effectw: When incentives are misaligned, the solution can make the problem worse.
- Incentives should align with goals: Always design incentives that truly promote the desired outcome, not just surface-level metrics.
- People follow the incentive, not the intention: If the reward system is clear, people will often pursue it even if it means ignoring the bigger purpose.
- Unintended consequences are common: When designing incentives, it is essential to predict possible side effects or alternative behaviors that could emerge.
- Review and adjust: Effective incentive systems should be monitored regularly to ensure they continue to work as intended.

== Rationality and Biases

One important concept we need to observe is rationality.
Traditional economics assumes that the aggregate behavior of a collective can be understood by the decisions of individual actos, where
each actor is looking for maximazing their own monetary gains and people make rational decisions with the information and choices given to them.
We will use this framework, or approach in our discussion as a start point, but we should be aware of its limitations, as a rationality assumption
does not always predict reality accurately. People are not always driven by monetary incentives alone.
They are also motivated by social norms, personal beliefs and even fairness, and these aspects are more difficult to model.

// add an example here ?

Another important concept is the cognitive biases: people  are risk averse and feel/fear losses more strongly that they feel/fear gains.

*Example*:

Imagine someone offers you two options:
- Option A: Receive $50 for sure.
- Option B: Flip a fair coin; if it lands on heads, you get $100, if tails, you get nothing.

What most people do:

- Most people pick Option A — the guaranteed $50 — even though the expected value of Option B is also $50 (0.5 × $100 + 0.5 × $0 = $50).

This is part fo prospect theory, Daniel Kahneman (behavioral economist) - Nobel Prize 2002.

Another finding in propect theory is that: the sensitivity to changes in losses or gains decreases with the amount.
Example: paying 20 dolars to deliver a mouse that costs 10 dolars is not acceptable, while paying 20 dolars to deliver your new 2000-dolar computer at home is acceptable.

Another concept is confirmation bias, which is our tendency to seek information that confirms what we are really believing,
even though there may be equally valid evidence to the opposite point of view. The default effect is people's tendency to stick with
pre-selected choices.

So, incentives and punishments can be tricky, we have to design incentives thoughtfully and stand in the shoes of the user.
This is specially important in blockchain systems where we rely heavily on behavior. 

*Takeaways*: Key Points on Rationality and Cognitive Biases

- Traditional economics assumes rationality: People are expected to make decisions that maximize their own monetary gains using available information.
- Reality is more complex: People are not purely driven by money — they also care about fairness, social norms, personal beliefs, and emotional factors.
- Cognitive biases shape decisions: People are often risk averse, preferring guaranteed outcomes over fair gambles, even when the expected values are the same.
- People feel losses more intensely than they value equivalent gains (loss aversion).
- The psychological impact of gains or losses decreases as the amounts increase (diminishing sensitivity).
- Confirmation Bias: People seek out information that supports what they already believe.
- Default Effect: People tend to stick with pre-selected or default options.
- Design matters: Incentives and penalties must account for human behavior and cognitive biases.
This is especially critical in blockchain systems, where behavioral incentives are central to system security and participation.

== Supply And Demand

Supply and demand are fundamental pilars of market equilibrium.
Generally, when price go up, demand falls, that's called the law of demand.
Or in other words, the quantity of a product demanded by the society decreases with price and
remains constant for a fixed price. The same is true for most good and services.
However, there are some exceptions such as luxury goods, like expensive watches, where a higher price can
actually increase the demand. But for most goods higher prices mean less buying.

Supply work on the opposite way. As prices increase, suppliers are willing to produce more of the goods.
That's the law of supply.

As a new product enters the market, the laws of supply and demand engage, and they will make the price
naturally converge to a value where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.
This is called the equilibrium price.

One interesting concept linked to supply and demand is the elasticity, which measures how sensitive
buyers an sellers are to price changes. High elasticity means even small price changes can significantly
impact the quantity demanded or supplied.  Low elasticity is the opposite, even if the prices varies
significantly the demand or supply is not affected.
An axemple of low elasticity are basic necessities goods like water, salt or gasoline,
even if the price goes up, people still need to pay for it.

*Takeaways*: Key Points on Supply and Demand

- Supply and demand are core to market behavior: They determine prices and quantities in a market.
- Law of Demand: When prices rise, demand typically falls. Higher prices usually lead to less buying.
- Law of Supply: As prices rise, suppliers are motivated to produce and sell more.
- Market equilibrium: Prices naturally adjust to a point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied — this is called the equilibrium price.
- Exceptions exist: Some goods, like luxury items (e.g. expensive watches), can defy the law of demand because higher prices may increase their appeal.
- Elasticity matters: It measures how sensitive buyers and sellers are to price changes.
- High elasticity: Small price changes cause large shifts in demand or supply (e.g., smartphone accessories).
- Low elasticity: Demand or supply stays stable even with significant price changes (e.g. gasoline, water, salt).
- Key insight: Understanding elasticity helps predict how markets will react to pricing strategies, taxes, or supply shocks.

== Market Structures And Strategies

- Perfect competition: the ideal situation where there are a lot of buyers of a product and a lot of firms selling it, with no single producers providing
to a large portion of the total supply. No single party can exert a large control over either the supply or the demand.

- Oligopoly: a marker with only few firms/providers. rather than competing on price, they tend to specialize their products to different market segments.

- Monopoly: a single firm controls all the available suplly of a product in the market. i
In this case, the price is not set as a function of the cost of production but instead, it is
set in terms of what buyers are willing to pay for it.
This model can be acceptable for elastic luxury good, but exploitative when applied to inelastic basic necessities.
That's the reason there are often laws to prevent abuses.

One of the most important economic concepts is the comparative advantage.
This concept explains why even if a person is capable of being self-sufficient and producing
all the goods they need, they are still better of specializing in a few products and trading them in the market.
Hence, taking that into account in a society of specialist, if people focus on their
comparative advantage, everyone will be wealthier than in a society without trading.
This principle can be applied to country-level specialization on a global scale.

*Takeaways*: Key Points on Market Types and Economic Strategies

* Perfect Competition:
** Many buyers and many sellers.
** No single firm or buyer can control prices or the market.
** Example: Agricultural markets like wheat or corn.
*  Oligopoly:
** A few firms dominate the market.
** Firms tend to differentiate products rather than compete purely on price.
** Example: Smartphone manufacturers or airline companies.
* Monopoly:
** One firm controls the entire supply of a product.
** The firm sets prices based on what consumers are willing to pay, not on production cost.
** Monopolies can be acceptable for luxury goods (elastic demand) but are dangerous for essential goods (inelastic demand), which is why anti-monopoly regulations exist.
** Example: Utility companies or patent-protected drugs.
* Comparative Advantage:
** Specialization increases efficiency and overall wealth, even when one party could theoretically do everything themselves.
** Trading based on comparative advantage leads to mutual benefits.
** This applies at both individual and country levels.


*Final Note*:
Understanding incentives and core economic principles is essential for designing better systems—whether they involve human-to-human interactions or automated processes.
