= Price Finding mechanisms

== Introductions

Price finding mechanisms (also known as price discovery mechanisms) refer to the processes through which the prices of goods, services, or assets are determined in a market.
These mechanisms are essential for efficiently allocating resources in an economy.
Prices serve as signals to both buyers and sellers, helping them make informed decisions about production, consumption, and investment.

So, we want understand how do buyers and sellers agree on prices for goods and services.
These ideas should work only for markets with perfect competition (not for monopolies or oligopolies).


=== Importance of Price Finding

- Signals for Resource Allocation: Prices indicate where resources are most needed. High prices typically attract producers, while low prices can signal excess supply.
- Balance of Supply and Demand: Price discovery helps to align the quantity supplied by producers with the quantity demanded by consumers.
- Market Efficiency: Accurate pricing reduces uncertainty and helps markets operate smoothly.

=== Factors Influencing Price Finding

- Market structure (perfect competition, monopoly, oligopoly)
- Availability of information
- Number of buyers and sellers
- External influences like regulations, taxes, and subsidies

=== Key Price Finding Mechanisms

- Auction Markets: Prices are set through competitive bidding, as seen in stock markets and commodity exchanges.
- Negotiation (Bargaining): Prices are determined through direct discussions between buyers and sellers, common in real estate and car sales.
- Posted Prices (Fixed Prices): Sellers set prices in advance, as seen in retail stores. Buyers decide whether to accept the price.
- Supply and Demand Interactions: In perfectly competitive markets, prices naturally adjust based on the forces of supply and demand.
- Government Intervention: Sometimes prices are regulated or set by authorities (e.g., minimum wage, price ceilings, or subsidies).


== Pricing posting: a basic model


=== Example: A Simple Price Finding Model


Scenario:

- Seller (Selena): Wants to sell one item.
- Buyers (Alice and Bob): Each has a private (secret) valuation of how much the item is worth to them.
- Key Assumption: The buyers' valuations are independently drawn from a known probability distribution (between 0 and 1), but their actual values are unknown to Selena.


==== Price Posting Mechanism

Selena chooses a single posted price (`𝑝`), and sells the item to the first buyer willing to pay that price.

*Probability of Sale*:

Since valuations are between 0 and 1, and assuming Alice and Bob's valuations are uniformly distributed:
The probability that both buyers are below the price is `p^2` (since the chance that Alice's valuation is below `p` is `p`, and Bob's valuation is also `p`, independently).
So, the probability of a sale is: `1 - p^2`


*Expected Revenue*:

Revenue is the price multiplied by the chance of a sale: `Expected Revenue = p * (1 - p^2)`
Selena should choose the price p that maximizes this expression.

Optimal Price: When you solve this optimization problem (by taking the derivative), the optimal expected revenue turns out to be approximately `0.38`.

*What shows this example*:

* Foundation of Price Mechanisms
** This is the simplest non-trivial example that introduces how sellers think about setting prices under uncertainty.
* Illustrates Trade-offs
** If Selena sets a high price, she makes more per sale but reduces the chance of selling.
** If she sets a low price, she increases the chance of selling but makes less money per sale.
** The balance between these is central to all pricing decisions.
* Leads to More Advanced Mechanisms
** This basic price posting mechanism is the starting point to show why auctions can outperform simple posted prices.
** It sets up the motivation for studying auctions and more sophisticated price discovery tools.
* Private Information
** This example introduces the concept of private valuations and how sellers must act under uncertainty, which is a core idea in auction theory, contract design, and real-world marketplaces.


*How This Example Connects to Other Price Finding Mechanisms*

|===
| Mechanism | Relevance to the Example

| Price Posting (Fixed Price)
| This is the mechanism being used here. Simple, easy to implement, but does not extract the full potential revenue because it doesn’t use competition between buyers effectively.

| Auction (e.g., Second Price Auction)
| Auctions can *force buyers to reveal their valuations* and create competition. In this same setup, an auction would typically generate *higher expected revenue* than price posting because it captures more of the buyers' willingness to pay.

| Negotiation
| In a one-on-one negotiation, the price would depend on each buyer's bargaining power. The example simplifies this by not including bargaining but could be extended to that scenario.

| Market Pricing (Supply and Demand)
| In larger markets with many buyers and sellers, the price tends to reflect the aggregate of all participants’ valuations. This small model is the building block for those more complex systems.

| Government-set Prices
| Not directly related here, but important to contrast with free market mechanisms like the one modeled. If Selena had to follow a regulated price, her profit-maximization strategy would be constrained.

=== Take-aways

- This example shows how sellers make decisions under uncertainty.
- Provides a simple but powerful model for understanding price setting.
- Highlights why more advanced mechanisms (like auctions) may be more effective.
- Builds intuition that scales up to more complex market scenarios.

== Auction mechanisms

An auction would typically generate higher expected revenue than price posting because it can capture more of the buyers’ willingness to pay.
An auction is a competitive game for buyers, where the seller makes the rules.

=== A. Static Auctions (Sealed-Bid Auctions)

*Key Feature:*  
All bids are submitted simultaneously and privately. Bidders cannot see or respond to each other's bids.

*Common Formats:*

* First-Price Auction:  
  The highest bidder wins and pays their own bid.
* Second-Price Auction (Vickrey Auction): 
** The highest bidder wins but pays the second-highest bid.  
** This format encourages bidders to bid truthfully (bidding your true valuation is the dominant strategy).

=== B. Dynamic Auctions (Open-Bid Auctions)

*Key Feature:*  
Bids are made *sequentially and publicly*. Bidders can observe others' bids and adjust their own.

*Common Formats:*

* Ascending Price Auction (English Auction): 
**  Starts at a low price.  
**  Bidders call out progressively higher bids.
**  Ends when no one is willing to bid higher.  
**  The most familiar auction type (e.g., Sotheby's).

* Descending Price Auction (Dutch Auction):
**  Starts at a high price.  
**  Price drops until someone accepts.  
**  Common in flower markets and IPOs.

| Feature            | Static Auctions              | Dynamic Auctions            

| Timing             | One round, simultaneous bids | Sequential, ongoing bidding 
| Information        | Bids are private             | Bids are public              
| Ability to React   | Cannot react to other bids   | Can react and adjust bids

=== Reserve Price

*Definition:*  
The minimum acceptable price set by the seller. If no bidder meets the reserve price, the item is not sold.

*Purpose:*
- Protects the seller from selling at too low a price.
- Influences bidding strategies and expected revenue.

=== Why Auctions Matter in Price Finding

* Auctions *force buyers to reveal their valuations.*
* Auctions often lead to *more efficient allocations and higher revenues* than simple posted prices.
* Widely used in:
** Art sales
** Spectrum licenses
** Online advertising (Google, Facebook)
** IPO pricing (Dutch auctions)

== Revenue Equivalence

Revenue equivalence is a concept in auction theory that states that given certain conditions, any mechanism that results in the same outcomes 
(i.e. allocates items to the same bidders) also has the same expected revenue. This is one of the most important results in auction theory.


== Summary
- Auctions are a powerful tool for price finding, specially in markets where there are few buyers and sellers or the value of the good is incertain.
- Different auction formats encourage different bidding strategies
- Many of these strategies under the right conditions, generate similar results in terms of revenue.
- Understanding these mechanisms can help sellers and buyers make better decisions in complex markets.


// second-price and english auction are strategically equivalent
// first-price and Dutch auctions are strategically equivalent
// Frontrunning in the context of auctions refers to:
// A situation where an insider uses privileged information to place bids before the auction, gaining an unfair advantage.
